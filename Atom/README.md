# Atom Editor Setup

This documents my Atom editor setup.

## packages.txt

* A list of packages which I have installed in Atom
* Generated by `apm list installed --bare`

## TODO

### Install Script

I need a script or a one-liner which parses packages.txt and does an install of
all the packages listed.

### Maintenance Command

I need a script or a one-liner for handling Atom updates. This should rebuild
all modules and reinstall all plugins. Alternatively there could be a script
which re-creates my setup from the scratch after deleting the $HOME/.atom
directory.
