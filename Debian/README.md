# Debian Setup

This file is written to be compatible with several different Debian
installations. I assume you're either running it with no GUI in a server /
Rapsberry Pi / Chromebook setting, or you are running it with Gnome Desktop.

Currently supported Debians are:

1. ChromeOS Crouton's Debian 12
2. Kali's Debian 13 Testing
3. Raspberry Pi OS Lite's Debian 12 (arm64)

Untested but hopefully working Debians are:

4. Ubuntu 24.04
5. Debian Sid (Unstable)
