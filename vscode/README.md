## Don't close tabs if you open files from sidebar

This is a stupid feature they implemented called "preview mode". I still don't
know why. Basically it means when you open a file from the sidebar and then try
to open a different file, the current tab is closed. Now if I wanted an editor
window closed, I'd just fucking use `ctrl+w`.

Fix:

1. Hit `ctrl+,`
2. Disable `Workbench › Editor: Enable Preview`
3. Disable `Workbench › Editor: Enable Preview From Quick Open`
