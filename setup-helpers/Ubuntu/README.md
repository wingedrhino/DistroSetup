# Ubuntu Configuration Automation

This repository contains scripts to automate the setup of Ubuntu 18.04 according
to my specific preferences.

This is largely based on my Fedora Installation Automation. I've been a long
time user of Fedora (which IMO has a vastly superior package manager that allows
rollbacks if something went horribly wrong and it also has delta-rpm that
greatly reduces upgrade sizes) but I think it is now time to switch to Ubuntu
because I'm getting very tired of not having niche software available for Fedora
like very new development tools or audio production software.
