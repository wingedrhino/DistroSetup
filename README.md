# DistroSetup

This repository contains instructions for a bunch of manual steps you may need
to do when setting up a fresh machine for development on GNU/Linux.

I am putting things here on GitHub so that things are easy to refer to quickly
whenever I have to reinstall a distro.

If you're brand new and setting up a Linux Distro, you might want to read the
`Manjaro` or `Ubuntu` subfolders here, and then move to `DistroAgnostic` for
finishing touches.
