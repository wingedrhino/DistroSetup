# ThinkPad L440

I bought myself a new ThinkPad L440. While the keyboard has been amazing, it is
nowhere close to my company issued ThinkPad T420 during my days as an intern for
Amazon.

This page shall document issues I faced in setting up their laptop and their
solutions. Under-investigation issues are also going to be listed here.

Current OS: Fedora 22 Xfce Spin

The couple of issues I am facing right now (double key-press and wireless) are
forcing me to strongly consider the prospect of returning this laptop.

## Double key-press Space Bar

Still looking for a solution for this. Randomly I end up typing double spaces.
The issue is prominent for  spacebar but is much less prominent for other keys.

## Horrible Reatek RTL8192EE

Connection drops frequently. Disconnect and reconnect seems to help most of the
time. Right now I am so pissed that I have resorted to using my phone as a USB
Ethernet modem to receive the wireless signals for me.

## Function and Control keys are swapped out

This is something really stupid which Apple and Lenovo do that irritate muscle
memory. Fortunately the fix on a ThinkPad is quick - there is a BIOS option to
swap the two keys.
