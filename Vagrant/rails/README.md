# Rails Setup

This is a Vagrantfile to setup a standard Rails environment which can also be
used on production.

Stack:

* Debian 8.0 "Jessie" Stable 64bit official Vagrantfile as base
* Ruby installed via Rbenv (currently 2.2.x)
* Rails installed via Gem (currently 4.x)
* PostgreSQL 9.4.x from PostgreSQL for Debian repository
* NGINX mainline (now 1.9.x) from NGINIX for Debian repository

If you want a preview of rails 5.x I'm making another provisioner for it.
